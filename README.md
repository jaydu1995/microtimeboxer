# Microtimeboxer

## Features
Right now the app is in it's earliest stage of development, as such the only feature available is the ability to receive a random timer between 1 and 6 minutes.

## Roadmap
The following will not necessarily be completed in order:

- Account creation.
- Ability for users to customize the range of time they will receive a random timer for.
- Ability for users to create tasks.
- Ability for users to organize tasks into buckets. 
- Logging so that users can see how much time theyâ€™ve spent doing tasks.
